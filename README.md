# Titanic Disaster Machine Learning Competition
===================================================

This repository contains the Python files I have created for solving the Titanic Disaster ML challenge. I have tried various machine learning models from random forest, boosted decision trees, linear regression, and etc. For each model I have implemented techniques to optimize the algorithms through gridsearch of optimal parameters and trained the model using cross validation to avoid overfitting the data.
