# Titanic-Disaster-ML-Competition

===================================================

This repository contains the Python files I have created for solving the Titanic Disaster ML competition. I have tried various method
from simple random forest implementation (basic) to optimizing the algorithm through gridsearch of optimal parameters 
and cross validation. For imputing the missing data, I begin by analyzing the statistical distribution of data based on age, class, or other factors.
This would provide an insight on the data based on which I could choose a statistically and logically plausible method for cleaning data.
