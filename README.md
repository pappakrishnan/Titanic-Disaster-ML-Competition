# Titanic Disaster Machine Learning Competition
===================================================

This repository contains the Python scripts I have developed for solving the Titanic Disaster ML challenge. It includes scripts for various ML techniques I have implemented and figures generated during data exploration steps. I have implemented various machine learning models such as random forest, boosted decision trees, linear regression, and etc. All the models are optimized through gridsearch method (sklearn) and validation is performed using cross-validation techniques to avoid overfitting.
